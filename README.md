# Supply The Community

This archived project was a proof of concept for a community app to help others find household necessities through crowdsourced information.

## How it works
Helpful community members could login with their Google account and submit a listing when they find a scarce item in stock.
Other members can "upvote" or "downvote" this listing or mark it as "out of stock" approriately.
Intergated with Google Maps to be able to show the revelant location of the item in stock.
